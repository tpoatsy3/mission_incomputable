Compiling:
mygcc -o subtemplate subtemplate.c

Usage:
/* 
* subtemplate.c - substitute text into a template file
* 
* usage: subtemplate target replacement
* where:
*   target is a string to be replaced wherever it appears in the input;
*   replacement is a filename for file containing replacement text
* output:
*   read the stdin, copying it to stdout, but wherever the 
*   target text is found, replace it with the contents of the 
*   replacement file.
* stdin: the input template
* stdout: the modified template
* stderr: error messages

Example command lines:

cat header.template | ./subtemplate @TITLE@ title.txt 
cat header.template | ./subtemplate @TITLE@ title.txt  | ./subtemplate @HEADCAPTION@ header.txt 

Exit status:
0 - success
1 - incorrect number of arguments
2 - bad target string
3 - cannot open replacement file
4 - error during input

Assumptions:

- replacement files should not contain subsequent target strings,
except where desired; in the second example above, if title.txt
contains @HEADCAPTION@ it will be replaced by the second
subtemplate; but if header.txt contains @TITLE@ it will not be
replaced; this assumption imposes order on the pipeline, and may or
may not lead to desired behavior.

"Non"-Assumptions:

- stdin and replacement file need not end with a newline
- stdin and replacement file may contain any characters
- target string may contain any characters (other than null, of course)
- target string may occur multiple times on a line, or in the file

Limitations:

- certain types of target strings will fail; for example, target
"ababc" will not be found in input "abababc".
